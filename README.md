# comp6841final
This is the final project for my Deep Learning course, COMP 6841.

2025-03-22
Datasets load class implemented

2025-03-23
runclass, just extracted from lab8, just adapted to the needs of the project. 

Next steps is to implemente a basic logistic regression to check the function of the model. 
Afterwards,

* review how to split the data. 
* MLP
* CNN
* RNN (sequence - many to one)
* transformers???
* pre-trained model.
